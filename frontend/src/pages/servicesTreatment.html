    <h3>Physiotherapy </h3>
    <div class="content">
    <section>
        <p>Physiotherapy focuses on restoring movement and function when you’re affected by injury, illness, or disability. At my clinic, each session is tailored to your specific needs, whether it’s recovering from surgery, managing chronic or acute pain, or improving mobility. I'm helping to work with your posture, movements and pain areas.</p>
        <br/><p>An individual treatment plan always begins with a detailed medical history. This is followed by a functional examination and testing of the affected areas. This allows limitations and abnormalities to become clear and solutions to be found together.</p>

    <h3>Manual Therapy</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Manual therapy uses hands-on techniques to diagnose and treat musculoskeletal conditions. It’s particularly effective for relieving tension, improving joint function, and reducing pain.
        Manual therapy is used on a very individual and joint-specific basis, both for chronic or acute pain, after an operation and for restricted joint movement. </p>

    <h3>Lymph Drainage</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <section>
        <p>Lymphatic drainage is a special massage technique  that aims to promote lymph flow in the body and thus support detoxification and the removal of excess fluid and waste products. The lymph nodes and pathways are stimulated so that they work better and the lymph is transported through the body more efficiently. This therapy is highly effective for reducing swelling and improving circulation.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Lymphatic drainage is often used after operations to reduce tissue swelling and improve healing, for lymphoedema or during pregnancy. It is a very gentle, pleasant and relaxing treatment.

    <h3>Functional training</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <section>
        <p>Functional training is a form of training that aims to improve everyday movement sequences and strengthen the body as a whole. It is based on natural movement patterns such as lifting, twisting, bending and stretching, which we perform constantly in our daily lives - be it when bending down, lifting weights or even walking and running.</p>
    <br/><p>The special thing about functional training is that it does not train individual muscles in isolation, but strengthens the entire body in integrated movements. This also addresses the stabilizing muscles that are important for good posture and better coordination.</p>
    <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving mobility and flexibility</li>
            <li>Strengthening the entire musculoskeletal system</li>
            <li>Injury prevention through balanced training of strength, stability and coordination</li>
            <li>Increasing performance in everyday movements and activities</li>
            <li>Promoting body awareness and better posture</li>
        </ul>
    <br/><p>Functional training is suitable for anyone who wants to improve their physical fitness - whether as part of rehabilitation, prevention or simply for general fitness.</p>
