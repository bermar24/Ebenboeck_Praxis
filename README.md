# EbenbÃ¶ck_Praxis_Website
# Introduction
During the first semester of Web Engineering (New Study Informatics â€“ DHBW) under the
guidance of Professor Ghada Hassan, our team has been tasked with developing a comprehensive
web solution for our client.

Our client is a private physiotherapist who recently relocated to the outskirts of Frankfurt and is
seeking to establish a stronger online presence. With her new clinic in an unfamiliar area, she aims
to make her services more visible and easily accessible to potential clients. The website will serve
as a platform to provide information about her treatments, workshops, and contact details,
ultimately helping her attract and connect with new clients.

To achieve this, we will begin by crafting a clear website strategy. This includes defining the
purpose and goals of the website, identifying the target audience, and conducting a competitive
analysis to understand how similar businesses operate online.

Throughout the project, we will maintain a close working relationship with the client through
regular meetings. This will allow us to incorporate her feedback at every stage and ensure that the
website design and style align with her vision and meet the needs of her target audience.

The next step will involve structuring the website and determining the appropriate design style
that reflects the clientâ€™s brand and appeals to her audience.

From a technical standpoint, we will develop the front-end of the website by creating the HTML
structure, styling it with CSS, and incorporating JavaScript to ensure functionality and
interactivity. Simultaneously, we will work on back-end development to manage data and provide
essential features.

Once the website is built, we will perform thorough testing to ensure usability and functionality.
Finally, we will assist in deploying the website by finding the ideal hosting solution, registering the
domain, and uploading the necessary files.

>[!NOTE]
>This project will allow us to apply the concepts and techniques learned during the semester while
helping our client establish a professional online presence that supports the growth of her
business.
