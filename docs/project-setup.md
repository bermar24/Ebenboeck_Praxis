# Project Setup

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions for setting up the EbenbÃ¶ck Praxis Website, a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using VS Code's Live Server extension for local development.

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** â€“ Download from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Live Server Extension** â€“ Install it from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bermar24/Ebenboeck_Praxis
   ```

2. Open the project folder in VS Code:

   ```bash
   cd Ebenboeck_Praxis
   code .
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Open VS Code and ensure the Live Server extension is installed.
2. Open the main `index.html` file.
3. Right-click inside `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

   The website should now be running locally at:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5500/
   ```

   (or a similar URL depending on your system configuration).
